+Question 1
+	How did you structure your transmit implementation?
+	In particular, what do you do if the transmit ring is full?
+
+Answer
+	The E1000 driver does not busy-wait on the queue, when the tx_desc's full it returns with
+	an appropriate error value. With that informantion, the output_helper_env can be cpu mindful
+	by yeilding the cpu, while hoping that the next time it will awake, the queue won't be full
+	and a succesfull re-transmit will be completed.
