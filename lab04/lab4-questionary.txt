=== Q Compare kern/mpentry.S side by side with boot/boot.S. Bearing in
===   mind that kern/mpentry.S is compiled and linked to run above KERNBASE
===   just like everything else in the kernel, what is the purpose of macro
===   MPBOOTPHYS? Why is it necessary in kern/mpentry.S but not in
===   boot/boot.S? In other words, what could go wrong if it were
===   omitted in kern/mpentry.S?
===   (free form)

The macro MPBOOTPHYS adjusts symbol addresses from thiery link address (KERNBASE+)
to their actual physical load address (MPENTRY_PADDR).

It is necessary becuase, mpentry.S is linked to run at high virtual addresses (KERNBASE+).
But it is copied and exectued at low address MPENTRY_PADDR (the APs execute it in real mode).

If the macro were omitted, then all memory refrences in the code would use the link-time
virtual address, which doesn't match where the code actuallu reside in physical memory.
(For example, the GDT descriptor) Leading to undefined behavior.

=== Q It seems that using the big kernel lock guarantees that only one
===   CPU can run the kernel code at a time. Why do we still need
===   separate kernel stacks for each CPU? Describe a scenario in
===   which using a shared kernel stack will go wrong, even with the
===   protection of the big kernel lock.
===   (free form)

Some actions happen before the kernel has acquired the kernel lock.

For example, when a trap occurs, the CPU hardware immediately switches
to the kernel stack and pushes a partial trap frame onto it. also in
kern/trapentry.S, before any C level trap handler is run. This means
the kernel stack is already being used by the CPU even before the kernel
gets a chance to take the lock. Later, in kern/trap.c in trap() the kernel
acuired the kernel lock.

Scenario,
CPU 0 switches to the kernel stack and pushes its frame.
Before CPU 0 acquires the lock, CPU1 traps and also pushes its trap frame.
If both CPUs shaed the same kernel stack, their trap frame would overlap
resulting in memory corruption.

To avoid this, each CPU has its own kernel stack.

=== Q Whenever the kernel switches from one environment to another, it
===   must ensure the old environment's registers are saved so they
===   can be restored properly later. Where does this happen?
===   (JOS function name)

=== Q In your implementation of env_run() you should have called
===   lcr3(). Before and after the call to lcr3(), your code makes
===   references (at least it should) to the variable e, the argument
===   to env_run. Upon loading the %cr3 register, the addressing
===   context used by the MMU is instantly changed. But a virtual
===   address (namely e) has meaning relative to a given address 
===   context--the address context specifies the physical address to
===   which the virtual address maps. Why can the pointer e be
===   dereferenced both before and after the addressing switch?
===   (one sentence, free form)

The kernel ensures that the kernel portion of the virtual address space (UTOP+)
is mapped identically in every environment's page table.
They all inherited the mappings of kern_pgdir.

=== Q In Ex. 9, what happens if the user environment runs out of
===   space on the exception stack?
===   (one setence, free form)

The kernel will detect so in user_mem_assert when setting up the utrapframe,
and destroy the current running environment.

=== Q In dumpfork.c, the first time you call duppage(), the function
===   allocates a page in one environment (env A) and then maps it in
===   another (env B). At what address is the page mapped in env A, and
===   at what address is it mapped in env B?
===   (ADDR(in env A):ADDR(in env B) (example: 0xAAAAAAAA:0xBBBBBBBB)

0x00800000:0x00400000

=== Q What challenge(s) have you chosen to implement? (specify

=== Q If the challenge requires changing the kernel source, list the
===   files which you have changed/added during implementation.
===   (one file per line, relative to lab directory containing .git/)

inc/env.h
kern/syscall.c

=== Q Describe you solution.

Challenge 8 - ipc_send with no loop
	When a ipc_send sees that a reciever is waiting to send data
	he will imediatly will send the data. Otherwise, he will leave
	the data he wanted to send in his Env structure and go to sleep.

	When a reciver requests to read data, before going to sleep (as
	he did before) he'll first check if anyone tried sending him data.
	If he found no one tried to before, he'll go to sleep. Otherwise,
	he'll collect the data waited for him, and wake them up.

	Add -DIPC_SEND_NO_LOOP to compile with this solution
